# OSOM CLI

Tired of all the commands I had to write to create a new project and connect it to a new repo, I thought about a solution in the form a "personal cli". And because open source is _osom_, everyone else can have it an tweak it and whatever you want to do with it.

## :dart: Purpose

For now the only thing `osom-cli` is able to do it to initialize your current working directory as a git repository, create a remote repo and link them together. Osom cli does all the first _fetching, pulling/rebase, commit_ of a new born repository and leaves it ready for you to start working on a fresh new project.

## Prerequisites

No prerequisites for installation

## :wrench: Installing

Install it with your preffered package manager

npm:

```bash
npm install -g @sebalinaresl/osom-cli
```

yarn

```bash
yarn add -global @sebalinares/osom-cli
```

## Usage

![osom-cli](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebaLinares/screenshots/master/osom-cli/osom-demo.jpg)

```bash
# Go to your preffered directory
mkdir project-name && cd project-name

# Call osom cli
osom

# Follow de instruction
# 1. Choose a name for your repo
# 2. Write a description (optional)
# 3. Choose a license for your project
# 4. Enter your username
# 5. Enter your gihtub password. It won't show as you type
# 6. Start working. Enjoy your project.
```
