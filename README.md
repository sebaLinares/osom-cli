# OSOM CLI! &middot; [![license-badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/osom-cli)](https://github.com/sebaLinares/osom-cli/blob/master/LICENSE) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/osom-cli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osom-cli) ![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg) [![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

Tired of all the commands I had to write to create a new project and connect it to a new repo, I thought about a solution in the form a "personal cli". And because open source is _osom_, everyone else can have it an tweak it and whatever you want to do with it.

## :dart: Purpose

For now the only thing `osom-cli` is able to do it to initialize your current working directory as a git repository, create a remote repo and link them together. Osom cli does all the first _fetching, pulling/rebase, commit_ of a new born repository and leaves it ready for you to start working on a fresh new project.

## Prerequisites

No prerequisites for installation

## :wrench: Installing

Install it with your preffered package manager

npm:

```bash
npm install -g osom-cli
```

yarn:

```bash
yarn global add osom-cli
```

or use it one time with `npx`:

```bash
npx osom-cli osom
```

## Usage

OSOM-CLI uses the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api) to create a remote repository, so a [Github Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) is needed in order to be authorized.

![osom-cli](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebaLinares/screenshots/master/osom-cli/osom-demo.jpg)

```bash
# Go to your preffered directory
mkdir project-name && cd project-name

# Create an .env file and add your Github Personal Access Token. Look at the documentation on personal access tokens provided above.
echo 'GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=' > .env

# Call osom cli
osom

# Follow de instruction
# 1. Choose a name for your repo
# 2. Write a description (optional)
# 3. Choose a license for your project
# 4. Enter your username
# 5. Enter your gihtub password. **Enter your Github Personal Access Token here**
# 6. Start working. Enjoy your project.
```
